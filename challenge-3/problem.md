# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

1. Spring 2025 Maple AI Inc Challenge Invitation Link: <https://codeforces.com/contestInvitation/a927cb11c6dc250d00366b665cc786ebafcf46ea>
2. Topics sampled from:

- Dynamic programming  
- Graphs  
- Ad hoc  
- Modular arithmetic  
- Binary search  
- Greedy/sorting  
- Divide-and-conquer  
- String  
- Combinatorics  
- Geometry  

Machine Learning (ML)

1. [easy] Given a dataset and a specific evaluation task (well-scoped), do it :)
2. [easy-medium] Given datasets (e.g., MRCR, GraphWalks, our own), do a rigorous study to improve the state-of-the-art performance.
3. [medium-hard] Brainstorm some ways to evaluate LLM models. After creating the criteria, run some benchmarks to compare the performances of some state-of-the-art models.
4. [medium-hard] Find your favorite dataset from <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets> and explore to find some interesting results.

Some Considerations

1. Consider hosting a ML contest in Kaggle?
2. Company-branded merchs?
